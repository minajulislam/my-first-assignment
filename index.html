        <h1>Without Limits</h1>
        <p>There are some things in life that are out of your control that you can't change and you've got to live with. The choice that we have, though, is either to give up or keep on going. I tell your life is interesting, Life is a journey. But I tell you there are sometimes in life where you fall down and you feel you don't have the strength to get back up. You see, if you try 100 times to get back up and if you fail 100 times, if you FAIL and you'll going to give up, do you think that you'll ever going to get up? No.</p><br>

Thus, they are interdependent.Interdependence has many advantages. For instance, it allows the benefits of advances in science and technology to reach different parts of the world within a short period.</p><br><br>
